    <h1 id="cpu"> Central Processing Unit</h1>
    The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is like the brain of a computer. It’s the part that does most of the
    thinking, calculating, and decision-making to make your computer work. Whether you’re playing a game, typing a
    school assignment, or watching a video, the CPU is busy handling all the instructions to get the job done.

    The CPU is usually placed in a special slot called a socket on the computer’s motherboard, which is like the
    main circuit board that connects all the parts of a computer. The CPU handles tasks like:

    Doing math calculations (like adding or multiplying numbers).
    Running apps or games.
    Input/Output (I/O) operations: Communicate with memory and peripherals.
    Storing and retrieving information during tasks.
    Types of CPUs

    CPUs come in different types, depending on how many cores they have. A core is like a mini-CPU inside the main
    CPU, and more cores mean the CPU can do more tasks at once. Here are the main types:

    Single-Core CPU: The oldest type, used in the 1970s. It can only handle one task at a time, so it’s slow for
    modern apps like games or web browsers.
    Dual-Core CPU: Has two cores, so it can handle two tasks at once. It’s faster and better for multitasking, like
    listening to music while doing homework.
    Quad-Core CPU: Has four cores, making it great for heavy tasks like video editing or playing modern games. It’s
    very fast and common in today’s computers. The story of the CPU started long ago and has some exciting
    milestones that changed how computers work. Here’s a simple timeline for students:

    1823: A scientist named Baron Jons Jakob Berzelius discovered silicon, a material still used to make CPUs today.
    1947: Scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley invented the transistor, a tiny switch that
    helped make modern CPUs possible.
    1958: Engineers Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce created the integrated circuit, which combined many transistors into
    a single chip.
    1971: Intel released the Intel 4004, the first-ever microprocessor (a CPU on a single chip), starting the era of
    personal computers.
    1979: Motorola introduced the Motorola 68000, a powerful CPU used in early computers and gaming consoles.
    1999: Intel launched the Celeron processors, making computers faster and more affordable.
    2005: AMD introduced the first dual-core processor, allowing CPUs to handle multiple tasks at once.
    2009: Intel released the Core i5, a four-core processor that made computers even faster.
    2017-2018: Intel introduced the Corte i9, one of the most powerful CPUs for desktops and laptops.

    <h1 id="reg"> Register </h1>
    A computer register is a small, high-speed storage location within the Central Processing Unit (CPU) used for
    temporarily holding data and instructions needed for immediate processing. Registers are the fastest type of memory
    in a computer, allowing the CPU to access and manipulate data extremely quickly, often in a single clock cycle. They
    are used for a variety of purposes, such as holding instructions, memory addresses, or the results of calculations.
    Functions and types of registers

    Data Registers: Hold data that is being processed.

    Address Registers: Store memory addresses to reference specific blocks of memory or other registers.
    Program Counter (PC): Stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
    Instruction Register (IR): Holds the current instruction that the CPU is processing.
    Accumulator (AC): A processor register that holds intermediate arithmetic and logic results.
    General-Purpose Registers (GPRs): Can hold both data and memory addresses, making them versatile for a wide range of
    tasks.

    Key characteristics

    Speed:
    Registers are the fastest storage accessible to the CPU, much faster than RAM or cache memory.

    Size:
    The size of registers (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) determines how much data the CPU can handle in a single operation.
    Location:
    They are physically located inside the CPU itself.
    Purpose:
    They act as a temporary workspace for the CPU to perform tasks efficiently.

    <h1 id="mem"> Memory</h1>
    Memory is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is
    the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.[1] If past events could not be
    remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop.[2] Memory loss is
    usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.[3][4][5][6][7][8]

    Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made
    up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.[9] This can be related to the
    neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and
    physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and
    retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions
    by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.
    Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store through various categorical models or systems.[9]

    Declarative, or explicit memory, is the conscious storage and recollection of data.[10] Under declarative memory
    resides semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning.[2]
    Meanwhile, episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane.[11][12][13]
    Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory.[2] Non-declarative, or
    implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information.[14] An example of a non-declarative
    process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming
    phenomenon.[2][14][15] Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that
    not all memory is consciously activated,[15] whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills
    that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.[2][14]

    Memory is not a perfect processor and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded, stored,
    and retrieved can all be corrupted. Pain, for example, has been identified as a physical condition that impairs
    memory, and has been noted in animal models as well as chronic pain patients.[16][17][18][19] The amount of
    attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.[2] Also, the
    storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory
    storage, such as the hippocampus.[20][21] Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be
    disrupted because of decay within long-term memory.[2] Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all
    affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory.
