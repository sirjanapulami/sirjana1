    Memory is the faculty of the mind by which data or information is encoded, stored, and retrieved when needed. It is
    the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action.[1] If past events could not be
    remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop.[2] Memory loss is
    usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.[3][4][5][6][7][8]

    Memory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made
    up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory.[9] This can be related to the
    neuron. The sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and
    physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and
    retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions
    by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material.
    Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store through various categorical models or systems.[9]

    Declarative, or explicit memory, is the conscious storage and recollection of data.[10] Under declarative memory
    resides semantic and episodic memory. Semantic memory refers to memory that is encoded with specific meaning.[2]
    Meanwhile, episodic memory refers to information that is encoded along a spatial and temporal plane.[11][12][13]
    Declarative memory is usually the primary process thought of when referencing memory.[2] Non-declarative, or
    implicit, memory is the unconscious storage and recollection of information.[14] An example of a non-declarative
    process would be the unconscious learning or retrieval of information by way of procedural memory, or a priming
    phenomenon.[2][14][15] Priming is the process of subliminally arousing specific responses from memory and shows that
    not all memory is consciously activated,[15] whereas procedural memory is the slow and gradual learning of skills
    that often occurs without conscious attention to learning.[2][14]

    Memory is not a perfect processor and is affected by many factors. The ways by which information is encoded, stored,
    and retrieved can all be corrupted. Pain, for example, has been identified as a physical condition that impairs
    memory, and has been noted in animal models as well as chronic pain patients.[16][17][18][19] The amount of
    attention given new stimuli can diminish the amount of information that becomes encoded for storage.[2] Also, the
    storage process can become corrupted by physical damage to areas of the brain that are associated with memory
    storage, such as the hippocampus.[20][21] Finally, the retrieval of information from long-term memory can be
    disrupted because of decay within long-term memory.[2] Normal functioning, decay over time, and brain damage all
    affect the accuracy and capacity of the memory.
