    <h1 id="reg"> Register </h1>
    A computer register is a small, high-speed storage location within the Central Processing Unit (CPU) used for
    temporarily holding data and instructions needed for immediate processing. Registers are the fastest type of memory
    in a computer, allowing the CPU to access and manipulate data extremely quickly, often in a single clock cycle. They
    are used for a variety of purposes, such as holding instructions, memory addresses, or the results of calculations.
    Functions and types of registers

    Data Registers: Hold data that is being processed.

    Address Registers: Store memory addresses to reference specific blocks of memory or other registers.
    Program Counter (PC): Stores the memory address of the next instruction to be executed.
    Instruction Register (IR): Holds the current instruction that the CPU is processing.
    Accumulator (AC): A processor register that holds intermediate arithmetic and logic results.
    General-Purpose Registers (GPRs): Can hold both data and memory addresses, making them versatile for a wide range of
    tasks.

    Key characteristics

    Speed:
    Registers are the fastest storage accessible to the CPU, much faster than RAM or cache memory.

    Size:
    The size of registers (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) determines how much data the CPU can handle in a single operation.
    Location:
    They are physically located inside the CPU itself.
    Purpose:
    They act as a temporary workspace for the CPU to perform tasks efficiently.
