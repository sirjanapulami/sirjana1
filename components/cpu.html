    The CPU is like the brain of a computer. It’s the part that does most of the
    thinking, calculating, and decision-making to make your computer work. Whether you’re playing a game, typing a
    school assignment, or watching a video, the CPU is busy handling all the instructions to get the job done.

    The CPU is usually placed in a special slot called a socket on the computer’s motherboard, which is like the
    main circuit board that connects all the parts of a computer. The CPU handles tasks like:

    Doing math calculations (like adding or multiplying numbers).
    Running apps or games.
    Input/Output (I/O) operations: Communicate with memory and peripherals.
    Storing and retrieving information during tasks.
    Types of CPUs

    CPUs come in different types, depending on how many cores they have. A core is like a mini-CPU inside the main
    CPU, and more cores mean the CPU can do more tasks at once. Here are the main types:

    Single-Core CPU: The oldest type, used in the 1970s. It can only handle one task at a time, so it’s slow for
    modern apps like games or web browsers.
    Dual-Core CPU: Has two cores, so it can handle two tasks at once. It’s faster and better for multitasking, like
    listening to music while doing homework.
    Quad-Core CPU: Has four cores, making it great for heavy tasks like video editing or playing modern games. It’s
    very fast and common in today’s computers. The story of the CPU started long ago and has some exciting
    milestones that changed how computers work. Here’s a simple timeline for students:

    1823: A scientist named Baron Jons Jakob Berzelius discovered silicon, a material still used to make CPUs today.
    1947: Scientists John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley invented the transistor, a tiny switch that
    helped make modern CPUs possible.
    1958: Engineers Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce created the integrated circuit, which combined many transistors into
    a single chip.
    1971: Intel released the Intel 4004, the first-ever microprocessor (a CPU on a single chip), starting the era of
    personal computers.
    1979: Motorola introduAced the Motorola 68000, a powerful CPU used in early computers and gaming consoles.
    1999: Intel launched the Celeron processors, making computers faster and more affordable.
    2005: AMD introduced the first dual-core processor, allowing CPUs to handle multiple tasks at once.
    2009: Intel released the Core i5, a four-core processor that made computers even faster.
    2017-2018: Intel introduced the Corte i9, one of the most powerful CPUs for desktops and laptops.
